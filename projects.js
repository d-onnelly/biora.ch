    summary: "Invoice lifecycle management system for small businesses dealing with multiple currencies, tax jurisdictions and legacy data. This is the second iteration of this program, which I originally created as part of my learning of C# on .NET Core. This was to assist in my 6th Year AS-Level coursework. This makeshift teaching system was actually used by a local business for over a year to manage their invoicing and projects, until I decided to recreate it as an online, easy-to-access and more robust system. The attached link shows a demo version of this, but it is not connected to a live database. In reality, this is used commercially now for businesses on the border, who have to deal with both Euro and Sterling currencies, accepting payments in both, and dealing with tax implications of both countries.",
